# Weekly Bill Split

For a group of Friends or Roommates, where one person spends for all people in the house (Food, Snacks, Grocery) and later splits the amount among them at Weekend. This tool can be helpful for the person who is spending, to keep track on the expenses spent Daily.

### How it works ?

* Each person can have a separate User Account. He **Logins**, creates a new **Book** and **Adds Person** into the Book. After a spend, he can **Split** the expense among the people added before. He can either add split to a **Single Person or Multiple Persons**,** Split Equally to All** or can **Split Individually**.
* He can then later edit (Modify/Delete) the entries using Edit Mode.
* He can switch to an another book or create new one under More dropdown.
* He can Mark as Paid for the persons after they paid the amount.
* All these data are saved in Database.
